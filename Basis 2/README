This is a quick introduction to the Python-side of the urinalysis test reader for Basis.
My environment has Python 3.7 installed. It has not been tested on other versions, but I would expect it to be compatible
with 3.6-3.8. Tread lightly though ...

There are four sub-directories within the main project directory:
1. Aruco Tags
These are images of Aruco tags that can be used on the Basis UA covers
2. Basis Urinalysis Covers
This is a PPT and SVG of the Basis UA cover
3. TempResults
This is a storage directory for temp results
4. Test Images
This is a storage direcotry for test images of UA strips, and for color analysis of the UA standards

There are a handful of Python files inside the main directory:
1. README
This current file. Good starting point!
2. requirements.txt
This is a requirements list for all python libraries used in this project. These requirements can be installed by:
cd /path/to/project
pip install -r requirements.txt
^ This may have to be pip3 depending on your configuration
3. AssayStandardCurve.py
This is the code used to generate the different standard curve/best fits for each assay. (Beware: messy ...)
4. generateArucoMarkers.py
Code to generate Aruco markers that are put on the Basis UA covers.
5. PlottingImagesToMakeMeasurements.py
Code to show the color chart images (images of the bottle of UA test strips) so HSV measurements can be made.
6. analyzeUrinalysisImage.py
The image processing algorithm. Does the heavy lifting.
7. urinalysisReader.py
The driver that should be called from your server. This calls analyzeUrinalysisImage.
